Studies that involved geriatric patients (at least 75 years old) saw no difference in safety or effectiveness compared to younger patients, though geriatric patients at an especially advanced age may be more susceptible to adverse effectsLabel. Dosage adjustments for patients with end stage renal disease(ESRD) are based on estimates of pharmacokinetic principles and not clinical studyLabel. Patients with ESRD may experience pharmacodynamics similar to those seen in well controlled studies but it may not lead to the same clinical effectsLabel. Dosage adjustments are not necessary in mild hepatic impairmentLabel.
